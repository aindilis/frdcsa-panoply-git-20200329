# FRDCSA Release Strategy Proposal

  
  

## Overview

To facilitate rapid public release of FRDCSA and to redefine the project so as to be more open for public collaborative development, [Panoply-Git](https://github.com/aindilis/frdcsa-panoply-git-20200329) would be unterminalized and become the main branch of the public FRDCSA project. Functionality from Andrew’s instance of the FRDCSA system would be transferred into Panoply-Git, or not, at his convenience.

  

## Purpose

To facilitate rapid public release of FRDCSA and to redefine the project so as to be more open for public collaborative development.

  

## Details

Right now FRDCSA can’t be released because it’s serving as Andrew’s personal configurations and is interspersed with his private data. Panoply-Git is a redacted partial version of Andrew’s FRDCSA system that he released for demonstration purposes but didn’t intend to maintain. The Panoply-Git system has always been considered terminal.

  

Since its release it has diverged from Andrew’s private FRDCSA system as he has continued to develop the latter. Andrew has considered developing scrubber/redactor tools to remove his private data to create a releasable version of FRDCSA that won’t be a terminal demo version like Panoply-Git and won’t have to diverge from his own system. He has estimated 1.16-2 years to finish the necessary tools to produce a “clean” redacted version of FRDCSA for public consumption. Andrew is likely the only one who could write these tools.

  

Instead of taking this approach, this proposal suggests to simply treat Andrew’s version of the FRDCSA system as his own personal configurations & private data, and to instead unterminalize the Panoply-Git system and deem it the main branch of the public FRDCSA project. Functionality from Andrew’s version would be transferred incrementally into Panoply-Git, or not, at Andrew’s convenience. The result would be that the FRDCSA project would be immediately opened up for public consumption and collaborative development.

  

This proposal would produce a divergence between Andrew’s version of FRDCSA and Panoply-Git, but that is intentional, as Andrew’s private personal configurations and the collaboratively developed public FRDCSA project should be two logically separate things that are maintained completely independently of each other.
